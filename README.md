# STA-215-project
This is my stats project where I completed an analysis of a political survey. I analyzed self reported levels of patriotism, trust in the supreme court, household income and opinions of the overturning of Roe V Wade. 

DATA
The data collected for this project was from a survey of a random sample of TCNJ students. 


OPERATIONALIZATION 

The concept of patriotism was operationalized by rating how patriotic an individual feels based on a quantitative scale from 1-10. 1 being not patriotic at all and 10 being very patritotic

The concept of the level of trust indivudals have in the Supreme Court to do the right thing was operationalized by turning it to an ordinal variable with 5 categories. Those being: "always trust", "most of the time trust", "sometimes trust", "rarely trust", and "never trust".

The concept of feelings toward the overturning of Roe V Wade was operationalized similarly to trust in the supreme court. It was turned into a qualitative variable indicating weather they supported the overturning or did not support. 

The concept of family earnings was operationalized and turned into a quantitaive variable by calculating the amount of money an individuals parents earned yearly in dollars.
